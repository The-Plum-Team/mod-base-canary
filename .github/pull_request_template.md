## Summary

<!-- What changed, and why is it needed? Keep this understandable without reading the diff. -->

## Scope

- Base branch:
- Minecraft version(s):
- Loader(s):
- Shared change or version-only change:
- Related issue:

## Implementation notes

<!--
Identify the owning sources, compatibility adapters, protocol/storage boundaries, or release
inventory rows affected by this change. Explain important tradeoffs and anything intentionally
left unchanged.
-->

## Validation

List every command run and its result:

```text
command -> result
```

- [ ] `git diff --check` passes.
- [ ] The smallest relevant unit/build check passes.
- [ ] `python3 scripts/ci/mod_base_kit.py run template check --repo .` passes.
- [ ] I documented checks that were not run and why.

## Repository safety

- [ ] I edited tracked sources, not generated output.
- [ ] I did not commit jars, Minecraft runtime files, screenshots, caches, secrets, or IDE output.
- [ ] I did not weaken assertions, bounds, validation, or CI gates to make the change pass.
- [ ] Managed mod-base files changed only through `mod_base_kit.py bump` or `template sync`.
- [ ] Any inspection or edit of a different branch used a separate ephemeral worktree, and no
      dirty or user-owned worktree was force-removed.
